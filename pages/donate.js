          As part of the official government Community Sponsorship scheme, the
          family will be eligible for state healthcare, schooling, universal
          credit, and rent support. Nevertheless, we have to raise a minimum of
          Â£9,000 in order to make an application to the Community Sponsorship
          scheme. The money which we raise is for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interpreters and English language tuition</li>
          <li>Gaps in rent support during the first 2 years</li>
          <li>Phones and communications technology</li>
          <li>Larger housing items such as a fridge and cooker</li>
          <li>Possible job re-training</li>
          <li>Other needs</li>
