        The Blandford Welcome Group (BWG) is a group of local residents who are
        working together to help a refugee family to settle in Blandford and
        rebuild their lives.</p>
        <p>The family comprises two adults and three young children, and they are due 
          to arrive in mid-December 2022. They are classified as highly vulnerable 
          by the UN High Commission for Refugees. A home in Blandford is available 
          for them to rent. Arabic is their second language.
          </p>
        <p>
        The BWG is committed to supporting the family to become independent, 
        assisting them for a period of two years (i.e. to end 2024), including providing 
        language tuition, interpreting, and assisting with access to all necessary 
        services, including healthcare, schooling and the Job Centre. They are eligible 
        for all state services and benefits, have indefinite leave to stay and work in 
        the UK, and will eventually have a pathway to British citizenship.

        <h2>How will we do this?</h2>
        <p>
          We are part of the governmentâ€™s Community Sponsorship Scheme for
          refugees, joining over 100 other local community groups across the UK
          working to welcome a family to their town. Community Sponsorship is a
          pathway for a family to settle and gain rights in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blandford Welcome Group is gaining official consent, creating a
          re-settlement plan, finding housing, and organising community support
          prior to the arrival of the family (likely in 2022/23) and for two
          years afterwards.

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          Millions of people have been forced to flee from their country to
          escape war, conflict, famine and abuse. We want to do something to
          alleviate their plight and to bring hope.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Blandford is a caring community and this project will also help
          transform our own community relationships and our view of the wider
          world. There is already a Syrian family settled in the town.

        <h2>Community Sponsorship and the BWG</h2>
        <p>
          Community Sponsorship was launched by the UK government in 2016 to
          augment the UK's commitment to welcome 20,000 refugees affected by the
          crisis in Syria by 2020. Since 2016, hundreds of refugees have been
          sponsored by local community groups like ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group is made up of people from all walks of life from Blandford
          and the surrounding area. We would love to welcome volunteers from
          across the entire community.
