            We are a group of Dorset residents who are working together to help
            a refugee family to settle in Blandford and rebuild their lives. The
            family may come from Syria, or from another conflict zone.

          <h2 className={styles.subHeading}>How will we do this?</h2>
          <p>
            We intend to become part of the government's Community Sponsorship
            Scheme for refugees and join around 100 other local community groups
            across the UK working to welcome a family to their town.

        <section className={styles.section}>
          <h2 className={styles.subHeading}>Why?</h2>
          <p>
            Millions of people have been forced to flee from their country to
            escape war, conflict, famine and abuse. We want to do something to
            alleviate their plight and to bring hope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blandford is a caring community and this project will also help
            transform our own community relationships and our view of the world.
            There is already one family of Syrian refugees successfully settled
            in Blandford.

          <h2 className={styles.subHeading}>What is involved?</h2>
          <p>As part of the government scheme, we will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Widen the volunteer team to involve more of the community and
              produce a clear resettlement plan.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Secure local authority consent to resettle the family.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Raise Â£15,000 to pay for language teaching, to meet initial gaps
              in rent support, to buy clothing, etc.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Find suitable housing for the family.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Meet the family at the airport and help them to settle into our
              community.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Arrange tuition in English; help with schooling, GP registration,
              etc.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Help the family make finance applications. The sponshorship scheme
              also entitles the members of the family to five year's full
              residency rights, after which they may apply for citizenship.
            </li>
            <li className={styles.listItem}>
              Support their independence, self-sufficiency and employment. The
              experience is that adults in refugee families are extremely keen
              to find work and to get off benefits when they are fit and able.
