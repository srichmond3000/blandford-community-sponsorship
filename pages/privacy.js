          our statutory obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone has rights with regard to how their Personal Data is handled

              The Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
              (e.g. where we pass on information to a local authority for
              safeguarding or other reasons).

          <ol type='i'>
            <li>
              We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it
              was obtained, unless you have explicitly agreed that we may share
              your Personal Data with another organisation or unless we are
